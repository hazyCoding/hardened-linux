# Block brute force attacks on ssh service
#
# Rate limiting is another useful feature of firewalls that can block connections that are obviously abusive.
# This is used to protect against an attacker attempting to bruteforce an open SSH port.
# Obviously you could whitelist the port to protect it entirely, but rate limiting is useful anyway.
# By default, UFW rate limits 6 connections per 30 seconds, and itâ€™s intended to be used for SSH.
sudo ufw limit ssh

# Restart it just to be safe

# This will:
# - Limit network-transmitted configuration for IPv4
# - Limit network-transmitted configuration for IPv6
# - Turn on execshield protection
# - Prevent against the common 'syn flood attack'
# - Turn on source IP address verification
# - Prevents a cracker from using a spoofing attack against the IP address of the server.
# - Logs several types of suspicious packets, such as spoofed packets, source-routed packets, and redirects.
